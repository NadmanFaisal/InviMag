## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

2-5 sentences describing what the system does
Our system is an inventory mangement system that can be used by organisations like: grocery stores, fashion brands, and electronic stores. The main idea behind our system is to help these organisation keep track of all of their inventory (what all products they have in stock), and for these organisations to be directly connected to the suppliers who provide them with their inventory. Our system will allow for inventory to be displayed and to be sorted based on various different attibutes like: price, quantity, date of purchase, etc. Our system will also be able to list suppliers and all the products that each supplier sells.

Our advanced feature would be a smart suggestor that looks at a resources that are currently in the organisations inventory and uses sorting and comparions to find other suppliers that offer the same resource for a cheaper value, hence helping the organisation cut on their cost in a smart manner. 



### Pages

* Home: The home page can be setup using the dashboard design pattern and it can display important statistics about the business, like the total cost of their inventory, or about products that are almost running out of stock, or a list showing the top selling products.
* Suppliers: The suppliers page can have a list of suppliers and it display important information about the supplier like, they kind of industry they are in or their country of origin etc.
* Products: A page that contains a list of all the products and which suppliers sell those products. It will also consist of important attributes of these products like their price, manufacture date, the country they are manufactured in etc. 
* Settings: A page that allows the user to change their passwords and username
